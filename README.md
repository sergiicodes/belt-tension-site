# belt-tension-site

This is a simple web calculator for calculating belt tension and frequency. It allows users to input various parameters such as span length, belt brand, belt width, pulley diameter, and RMS torque. The calculator automates the calculation process, enabling the distribution and open-source sharing of belt preparation mathematics. This tool was developed to extend the accessibility of belt tension calculations beyond my specific role. As a professional involved in robotics and machines with belt drive applications, ensuring belt drive reliability by accurately calculating the required tension (N) is a critical responsibility.

Here's an example of a given system with a belt drive:

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Fill in the required input fields with the appropriate values.
4. Click the "Calculate" button to calculate the tension and frequency.
5. The result will be displayed below the form, showing the frequency range.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (in-line)
- JavaScript (in-line)

## Customization

You can customize the calculator by modifying the code. Here are some possible modifications:

- Adding additional input fields or parameters.
- Changing the styling using CSS.
- Modifying the calculation logic in the JavaScript code.
