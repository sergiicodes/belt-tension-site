# belt-tension-site

This is a simple web calculator for calculating belt tension and frequency. It allows users to input various parameters such as span length, belt brand, belt width, pulley diameter, and RMS torque. The calculator then calculates the tension --> frequency based on the provided inputs.
The motivation behind making this calculator was to be able to distribute and open-source the math behind preparing the belts used in manufacturing machines beyond just my role. In my job I usually am tasked with calculating the tension (N) required for the given application for a machine's belt drive to ensure that the belt drive does not fail.

An example of a given system:

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Fill in the required input fields with the appropriate values.
4. Click the "Calculate" button to calculate the tension and frequency.
5. The result will be displayed below the form, showing the frequency range.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (in-line)
- JavaScript (in-line)

## Customization

You can customize the calculator by modifying the code. Here are some possible modifications:

- Adding additional input fields or parameters.
- Changing the styling using CSS.
- Modifying the calculation logic in the JavaScript code.
